  "summary": "The implementation covers most of the core requirements including Internet Identity authentication, user profiles with creation and update capabilities, follow/unfollow system, post creation with up to 5 images, chronological news feed, likes, comments, user search, and a Facebook-like layout with blue and white theme. However, several features appear to be incomplete or missing based on the provided diff evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Implement chronological news feed showing posts exclusively from users that the current user follows",
      "reason": "The backend shows 'getNewsFeed' returns all posts sorted by timestamp with no filtering logic based on follow relationships. Frontend uses this same feed for both the main feed and profile pages without filtering.",

      "reason": "FollowButton component hardcodes 'isFollowing={false}' on ProfilePage, meaning the UI does not reflect the actual follow state and cannot display the correct button state.",
