- Build post creation with text and up to 5 images per post
- Create chronological news feed showing posts only from followed users (newest first)
- Add like/unlike functionality for posts
- Implement commenting system on posts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can sign up with Internet Identity, create and customize their profile, follow other users, create posts with text and images, view a personalized feed of posts from followed users, like and comment on posts, search for users, and view user profiles on both mobile and desktop devices.
